1. Move around with the left thumbstick or teleport by holding down the right thumb stick to generate the teleport indicator. Release the right thumbstick to teleport to the indicated location.

2. Grab with the grab button on the controller to move objects around.

3. When an object is grabbed, grab it with both hands and pull outwards to expand the object or push inwards to shrink it.

4. Atoms can be attached and detached together to form molecules using covalent bonds (the cylinders) by grabbing the atoms and placing them in the snap zone, or pulling them off to break molecules into atoms again.
